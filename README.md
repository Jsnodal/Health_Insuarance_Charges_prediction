Machine Learning Model for Predicting Insurance Charges
Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model that predicts insurance charges based on user attributes like age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region. The model is deployed as a web application, allowing users to input their data and receive predictions for their insurance charges.

Key Features:
Predict insurance charges based on user input.
Input parameters include:
Age
Sex
BMI
Number of children
Smoking status (Yes/No)
Region
The model is trained using historical data and can predict a user's insurance charges with reasonable accuracy.
Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language for machine learning and web development.
Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model creation and evaluation.
Pandas & Numpy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
joblib: For saving and loading the trained machine learning model.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization (optional for exploratory analysis).
Getting Started
Prerequisites:
To run the project, you will need the following:

Python 3.x
pip: Python package manager
Basic knowledge of Python, machine learning, and web app deployment.
Installation Steps:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/jsnodal/insurance-charges-predictor.git
cd insurance-charges-predictor
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have requirements.txt, you can install the required packages individually:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit joblib
Download or load your pre-trained machine learning model (in this case, the reg_model.joblib file) into the project folder.

To train the model (if not already trained):

Run the script train_model.py (or whatever the training script is named) to train your model and save it.
Example:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Running the Application:
Start the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501).

Enter the required details (age, sex, BMI, etc.) into the input fields, and click the "Predict" button to receive an insurance charge prediction.

Model Description
This project uses a Stacking Regressor model, which combines multiple base models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to improve the overall prediction performance. The model is trained on historical insurance data, and the final estimator used is a Linear Regression model.

The data preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables (e.g., 'sex', 'smoker', 'region')
Feature scaling for numerical variables (e.g., 'age', 'bmi')
Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
R-squared (RÂ²): Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
Usage
Input:

Age (numeric)
Sex (male/female)
BMI (numeric)
Number of children (numeric)
Smoker (yes/no)
Region (southeast, southwest, northwest, northeast)
Output:

Predicted insurance charges based on the input data.
The user simply enters their data into the web form, and the model predicts the insurance charge.

Example
For example, if a 40-year-old woman with a BMI of 28.5, 2 children, and a non-smoking status from the southeast region inputs the details, the model will predict an insurance charge based on these features.

Example Prediction:
Age: 40
Sex: Female
BMI: 28.5
Children: 2
Smoker: No
Region: Southeast
The model will output the predicted insurance charge for this input.
